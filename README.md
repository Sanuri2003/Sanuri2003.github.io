# About Me

#### I am Sanuri Adithya Dunu Arachchi, a highly motivated individual with a strong passion for Biological Sciences, encompassing fields like Zoology, Botany, Microbiology, and the laboratory technologies associated with them. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Biotechnology at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology. My enthusiasm for life sciences drives me toward a career where I can make meaningful contributions to advancing scientific knowledge. I believe that the future will be shaped by these disciplines, and I am committed to playing an active role in that evolution. I am eager to continue learning and growing within the scientific community while honing my skills for future research and professional endeavors.

[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using *Python*. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used *Matlab* to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
